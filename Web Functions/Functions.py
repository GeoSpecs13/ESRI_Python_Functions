@Creator Andrew Sauerwin
In this file is a list of functions that can be used to leverage automation tasks within ArcGIS Portal and even ArcGIS Online.
The idea is that this set of functions can be leveraged as imports for other scripts. Simply Place the library in the Python home folder.
Then import from the library as needed.

Expect updates over time.

    Generates a log of detailed information about a Portal User's details. 
    The primary use was to obtain the user's last login details to see when/or if a user has accessed a portal environment. 
    
    The script will log the following:
    1. Full Name
    2. Username
    3. Email
    4. User Access
    5. Role
    6. Level (whether they are a level 1 or 2 user)
    7. Users Associated Groups #Is modified to not list right now but can if the client want's this information
    8. Last Modified Date
    9. User Created Date
    10. User Last Active Date

    1. role is the assignment you want to search on for the groups of users you are interested in.

    2. max_user_count is set to the number of users you want to identify as the maximum. This could be 
    everyone in the organizations portal environment.
    3. doc is set to the csv or excel spreadsheet containing the information of interest. User IDs in this case.
    these contents will also be appended to a list in the script to be worked on later in the code.
    4. level_change is set to identify the users license level in Portal. As of right now, this can either be
